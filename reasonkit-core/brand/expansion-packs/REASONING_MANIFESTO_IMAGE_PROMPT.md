=== FINAL ARTISTIC DIRECTION ===
This is not a marketing poster. This is a technical artifact. It should look like it was generated by a machine, designed by an engineer, and printed by a precision instrument. Every element serves a purpose. Every line is intentional. Every color is specified. This is "Designed, Not Dreamed" made visual.

The poster should feel like:
- A system diagnostic output
- An engineering blueprint
- A technical specification document
- A machine-generated report
- A high-tech product manual

It should NOT feel like:
- A marketing brochure
- A promotional flyer
- A casual design
- An artistic interpretation
- A playful illustration

The aesthetic is: Industrial. Precise. Authoritative. Technical. Professional. Systematic. Structured. Auditable. Reliable.

=== GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS ===
Use advanced AI image generation (DALL-E 3, Midjourney v6, Stable Diffusion XL) with the following approach:

1. **Primary Prompt:**
 "Technical schematic poster, A2 format, deep black background (#030508) with subtle hexagonal grid overlay, exploded wireframe polyhedron centerpiece in cyan and purple, large white text 'DESIGNED, NOT DREAMED.' at bottom, technical audit log in right margin fading to transparent, industrial aesthetic, sci-fi interface design, high contrast, precise lines, matte finish, 300 DPI, professional technical drawing style"

2. **Style Modifiers:**
 - "engineering blueprint"
 - "technical documentation"
 - "sci-fi interface"
 - "industrial design"
 - "minimalist poster"
 - "cyberpunk aesthetic"
 - "high-tech"
 - "precision rendering"

3. **Negative Prompts (avoid):**
 - "marketing"
 - "promotional"
 - "colorful"
 - "playful"
 - "artistic"
 - "hand-drawn"
 - "sketchy"
 - "watercolor"
 - "painting"
 - "illustration"
 - "cartoon"
 - "3D render" (unless specifically wireframe)

4. **Iteration Strategy:**
 - Generate base composition
 - Refine polyhedron detail
 - Adjust typography positioning
 - Fine-tune color accuracy
 - Add data overlay
 - Final polish and contrast adjustment

=== QUALITY CHECKLIST ===
Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All colors match brand palette exactly
- [ ] Typography is crisp and readable
- [ ] Polyhedron is clearly defined and exploded
- [ ] Grid is subtle but present
- [ ] Data overlay fades correctly
- [ ] Overall composition is balanced
- [ ] No unwanted artifacts or glitches
- [ ] Resolution is sufficient for print (300 DPI minimum)
- [ ] Text is legible at intended viewing distance (1-2 meters)
- [ ] Brand identity is clearly represented
- [ ] Industrial aesthetic is maintained throughout
- [ ] "Designed, Not Dreamed" philosophy is visually communicated

=== USAGE ===
- Print: A2 or A3 poster for office walls
- Digital: High-res version for website hero section
- Social: Cropped versions for social media (1200x1200px square)
- Documentation: Included in brand guidelines
- Swag: Premium developer swag (no T-shirts, high-art posters only)

=== ALTERNATIVE VARIANTS ===
Consider creating variants:
1. **Light Mode:** Inverted colors (white background, black text) - for light-themed offices
2. **Minimal:** Simplified version with just text and polyhedron
3. **Animated:** Web version with subtle animations (polyhedron rotation, text fade-in)
4. **Interactive:** WebGL version with 3D polyhedron that responds to mouse/touch
